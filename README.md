# Back To Earth
### The working title for an anxiety management project
This is a tool for anyone in a high-pressure work environment that doesn't have time for
real therapy or mainstream "self-care", and just needs something to help them push forward
after they start to feel anxious at work. Just something to bring them back to Earth, so 
they can continue with their day.
